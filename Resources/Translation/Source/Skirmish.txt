Welcome to the tutorial. Drill your way north to start. Your ultimate goal is to defend base from incoming wave of enemies. There will be objectives to guide you, but feel free to do things in any order.
Fun begins

Get items from the chest.
Make a pistol and some ammo at the workshop.
Dig up the metal and Lumen deposit.
Interact with the metal vein to build a Miner.
Place a Storage Container next to the Miner.
Use the other workshop to upgrade your drill twice.
Use build menu to place a Power Expander to power buildings.
Get a Lumen Clump, select it in inventory and throw at the Shredder.
Use your upgraded drill to reach the Lab.
Put another Power Expander to power the Lab.
Research any tech at the Lab.
Upgrade any stat at the Scout Center.
Use the Repair Gun to repair damaged structures.
Upgrade any turret.
You are now ready to face the enemies. You can use Reactor to shorten the waiting time.
Survive.

Shredder can be used to extract Lumen Clumps. Just drop the items in it.
Upgrade your drill to mine stronger materials. You need 2 upgrades to get past the green rocks in the west.
Here you can make weapon and ammo to defend yourself.
You can speed up the wave here if you don't want to wait.
Explosives are useful for quick mining.
If you put a Storage Container next to a Miner, it will automatically collect resources. Stored resources are automatically used when your inventory is not enough.
Buildings need to be powered to work. Place some Power Expanders where necessary.
Use Lab and Scout Center to permanently upgrade your character and other aspects. You can check your acquired technologies in the Map menu. In co-op, Scout Center upgrades only the player who built it, so each player needs their own.
Explore the map to prepare for the incoming enemy wave.
When you die, a clone replaces your dead character. If you don't have spares, it's game over. Note that normally you drop all items on death; this is disabled in the tutorial.
You can make more Flares and other useful items when you place Utility Workshop.
