NOTICE
The editor in demo is [color=red]preview only[/color]. You can [color=yellow]create[/color], [color=yellow]edit[/color] and [color=yellow]play[/color] a map, but you [b]can't[/b] save, publish nor load any files, which means that [b]whatever you create will be lost[/b]. No other functionality is disabled, so you can test the editor's capabilities.
