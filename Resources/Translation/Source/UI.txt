# Campaign

Welcome Scout!\nSo you got to the base in one piece, good. I’d say I hope you’ll find it adequate, but I won’t - after all, it’s your job to expand it.\nAs a reminder - your mission is acquiring 3 Lumen Chunks. They are huge rocks of very condensed Lumen. It's the ultimate energy source. 3 of them will be enough to cover all our energy needs for a few hundreds years.\nUltimately, we want to establish a settlement here. The Earth became unhabitable, so this is our only chance.\nGo to the Elevator and delve down to complete missions. Missions will yield you rewards, including new buildings for your base.\nUse the facilities provided to upgrade your gear and constructions. It's crucial for your success.\nGood luck Scout! The fate of humanity depends on you.

Main Mission Status\n%d out of 3 Lumen Chunks delivered.\n\nHub Instructions\nUse the Elevator to bring up mission selection screen and select your next destination.\nCompleting missions will provide you with permanent rewards.\nThe Lumen you get from completing missions can be used in Hub to permanently upgrade your performance.\nUpgrades you unlock during mission will not carry to other missions.

Good job, you finished your first mission. You can use the Lumen you got as a reward to buy upgrades.

Good job, Scout!\nYou have sucessfully secured the three Lumen chunks. This solves our energy problems for a very long time. The humanity can now rebuild in peace, all thanks to your hard work and persistence. You are a hero!\nWhat will you do now? Retire and lead a quiet life, in the newly established settlement? Ha, who am I joking. Your help is still needed. If you feel like you need more action, and I bet you do, there is one final assignment. Head to the elevator for more info.\nWhatever you choose, we thank you on behalf of the whole human race. Good luck in your future endeavours, Scout!
